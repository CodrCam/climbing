                I began climbing in Seattle. Where I went to bouldering gyms. 
                A gym that doesn't require you to rope up and so the barrier to entry is low.
                I then moved out of the city and began skiing more. 
                In doing so figured out I enjoy teaching and wanted to teach people to reach far out places. 
                I began my guide training in 2020 at the American Alpine Institute. Where I learned to travel
                across glaciated terrain, traditional and ice climbing. Plus many other technical skills to lead
                peolpe into dangerous places.
